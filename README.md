# Water Real Estate Fund Agent

## Overview
The Water Real Estate Fund Agent is a tool designed to identify undervalued real estate opportunities that can be unlocked by enabling water and wastewater technologies. These opportunities may include properties that lack access to municipal water service, cannot drill a well, do not have water rights, cannot access sewer services, or cannot build an onsite wastewater treatment system. Additionally, it identifies properties that do not have access to sufficient water for their highest possible use.
